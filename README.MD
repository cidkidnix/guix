Guix for NixOS
-----

What differs this fork from Emiller's and BQV's?
* I'm going to keep this (mostly) updated with guix's ``master`` branch

-----

Notes:
* This is a Nix Flake
* This is a WIP based off of Emiller88's and BQV's initial work

TODO:
* Fixup various things
* Make a default.nix compatible with non-flake nix
